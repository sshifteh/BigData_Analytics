# BigData_Analytics
*******************************************************
This folder contains projects that aim to analyse data by using libraries such as pandas, scikit learn, tensorflow, numpy, matplotlib etc. 
Tools used are Python 2.7 on MacOS 10.12.

PROJECT 5: 
This project is from Peter Sergio Fl√∏gstad's tutorial about building a neural network in tensor flow. 
As of now the placeholders, variables, operations, softmax, cost and optimization part is done. 
In works is the sessions part. 
Files in this project are: 

ML_tensorflow_HRdata.py : this file contains the code for the building of the neural network.

HR_comma_sep.csv: this is the dataset used

PROJECT 4: 
This project is an analysis of the paper "Using Data Mining for Bank Direct Marketing: An Application of the CRISP-DM Methodology" by Moro and others. 
It is a quality check of the support vector machine and decision tree model. In addition a k-nearest neighbour is tested. 
One of the main findings is the feature importance. 
Files in this prosject consists of:

ML_bank_data.py: Which creates a pandas dataframe of the data. And formats and explores the data befoer the assesing.
It analyses the SVM with a Gaussian kernel and the Decision tree model in the paper. In addition to testing hypothesis about the features.
It arrives at a feature importance plot to compare to the one in the paper. 

ML_knn_bank.py: Analyses the knn classifier on the dataset. 

bank.csv: Is the dataset used in the analysis files. 

bank-data-info.txt: Explains the features in the dataset.

PROJECT 3: 
This project is a Machine learning classification project with the fruit data set, where fruit is characterized with certain features. 
The files are:
ML_fruit_data.py: examines and plots the data. Then uses the classifiers to label the test data and the decision boundary 
is plotted. 

fruit_data_with_colors.txt: is the dataset containing the fruit characteristics and labels.

PROJECT 2: 
This project is an examination of a consumer dataset. 
The files in this project are: 

examine_sample_orders.py: where the data is formatted, examined and explored. And hypothesis are tested using frequency plots. 

SampleOrders.csv: is the dataset with the consumer information.

PROJECT 1: 
This project is about tidy up and formatting a really messy file in order to be able to use the data to answer specific questions. 
The dataset is the GDP of all the countries in the word. And the question could for example be which has the highest or lowest according to the data. 
However the data is really messy with many duplicate entries and too many features. So this is a challenging task.

The files are: 
BigData_loading_handling_formatting.py: this program aims to load and format the data.

WEOAPr2017all.csv: is the data set.
